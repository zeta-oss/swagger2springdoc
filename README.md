## Why 📚

Most dev-teams are fairly comfortable performing operations on Swagger specifications such as, 

1. Stitching APIs together to create a cohesive OAS 3 Spec
2. Changing request/responses on APIs

However there comes a point when you have too many microservices that it makes sense to programatically extract swaggers from your services for use in various frontend swagger visualization tools like [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

This tool helps create Annotations for [Springdoc](http://springdoc.org)

## How 💻

1. Simply go to [swagger2springdoc](https://swagger2springdoc.glitch.me/)

2. Paste a Swagger specification like the one [here](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json)

3. Copy paste Annotations for each API into your Codebase

4. ? ? ? 

5. Profit!
